# Prototyping in Figma (Figma-along)

## What is Figma?

Figma is a powerful tool that lets us design and prototype web apps before we develop them.

---

In this demo, we're going to prototype a few UI elements in a book sharing app. We'll be building these UI elements as [components](https://help.figma.com/article/66-components) that can be reused across our design.

### The Goal

> The mini prototype we'll be making

## Getting started

Create an account and log in at figma.com.

Clone this repo:

`git clone https://github.com/bobbysebolao/figma-prototyping-tutorial.git`

We won't be doing any coding, but it contains the images that we'll add to the prototype we'll be making.

## Useful keyboard shortcuts in Figma

- **A** - Frame Tool
- **R** - Rectangle Tool
- **T** - Text Tool
- **Hold Option + arrow key** - move selected object 1px
- **Hold Shift + arrow key** - move selected object 10px
- **Cmd + G** - Group all selected objects together

<!-- - Emphasise that a frame is like one screen from your app
- Every component must be contained inside a frame
- We'll auto resize our frame to match the iPhone 5 screen size (320x480px)
- And we'll add a layout grid to help us position our components within the frame (6 col, 20px margin, 10px gutter)

- Animations
- Figma Plugins (icons)
- export css feature
- export as SVG -->
